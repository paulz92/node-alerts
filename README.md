# Pokemon Alerts

A Node.js app which sends system alerts every minute with a random pokemon. The purpose of the app was to build a Node app which calls an API and displays the data via your computer's system notifications using JavaScript.

Thanks to the devs at [Pok√©api](https://pokeapi.co/) for the API.
